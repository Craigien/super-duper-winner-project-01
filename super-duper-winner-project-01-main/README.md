## Description
This is a blackjack online card game web application.
It allows the user to bet a desired amount of "money" in each round.
The objective is to increase your starting funds by winning against the dealer.
This is done by obtaining a score of or cloest to 21 points without "busting"
(i.e. busting means going over 21 points).

## Installation

Once you click the 'quick play' button, the round will begin and you can 'hit' which gives you another card, or 'stay' which means you don't get another card.
